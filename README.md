# Jets Project

## Description
Jets is a project that allows the user to manage an airfield. On start-up the airfield is populated with 5 types of jets. The program then displays a menu for the user to choose from.

### Menu example
1. List fleet
2. Launch all jets
3  View fastest jet
4  View jet with longest range
5. Load all Cargo Jets
6. DogFight!
7. Load Passengers
8. Add a jet to FLeet
9. Remove a jet Fleet
10. Quit

The program then takes user input using a Scanner and responds properly via a switch statement.

Each menu item will call the corresponding method through the airfield object.  The Menu will be shown after each method call, until the user enters "10". At which time the program will stop.
### Technologies used
eclips
java
file io
UML design
OOB principles
Comma separated file
String Builder
abstract class
Interfaces
comma separated list

### Lessons Learned
Writing dynamic code is more intuitive then I thought
Creating a UML design before starting to code really helped me visualize the project. It also helped me once i was getting into the actual coding to stay on track and not get lost.
